          </p>
          <h5>How We Use the Information We Collect</h5>
          <p>
            We use information we collect from you to create your account,
            provide you the features and functionality of the Service, to
            communicate with you about products and services you’ve purchased,
            to offer additional products and services, to bill you, to carry out
            our obligations and enforce our rights arising from any contracts
            entered into between us and you, to fulfill any other purpose for
            which you have provided the information, in any other way we
            describe when you provide the information, and for any other purpose
            with your consent. When you use the Service, including accepting a
            payment, contacting customer service, requesting technical support,
            or engaging in many other interactions with Checkbook, we will apply
            the information that we have collected. Knowing this information
            allows us to verify your identity, communicate with you, enforce our
            agreements with you, and secure the best possible experience for all
            Checkbook customers by ensuring compliance with applicable US state
            and federal laws and our own policies. We may also use this
            information to improve and enhance our offerings to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use the information collected by “cookies” so that our Website
            can remember you and provide you with the information you’re most
            likely to need. For instance, when you return to the Website,
            cookies identify you and prompt the site to provide your username
            (not your password), so you can sign in more quickly. Cookies also
            allow our Website to remind you of your past usage and to suggest
            similar products and services. We also use information gained
            through cookies to compile statistical information about use of our
            Service such as the time users spend at the site and the pages they
            visit most often. Those statistics do not include Personal
            Information.
          </p>
          <p>
            We use information we collect from you to the extent necessary to
            enforce our Website Terms of Service and to prevent imminent harm to
            persons or property.

          <h5>Sharing Your Information With Third Parties</h5>
          <p>
            Checkbook will not rent or sell your Personal Information to third
            parties. We may store it in locations outside the direct control of
            Checkbook – for instance, on servers or databases co-located with
            hosting providers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Checkbook will share your Personal Information with a limited number
            of Checkbook partners for the explicit purpose of providing services
            to you. If we do this, such third parties’ use of your Personal
            Information will be bound by terms at least as restrictive as this
            Privacy Policy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Checkbook will also share your Personal Information if we are
            required to do so by law or subpoena, or if we believe that such
            action is necessary to conform to the law or comply with the legal
            process served upon us, or to investigate, prevent, or take action
            regarding suspected or actual illegal activities. We will also share
            this information to enforce or apply our Terms of Use and other user
            agreements, including for billing and collection purposes, to take
            precautions against liability, to investigate and defend ourselves
            against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government
            enforcement agencies, or to protect the security or integrity of our
            site. We will also share Personal Information if we believe that
            disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights,
            property, or safety of Checkbook, our customers, or others.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we develop our business, we may buy or sell assets or business
            offerings. Checkbook may share your Personal Information with a
            buyer or other successor in the event of a merger, divestiture,
            restructuring, reorganization, dissolution, or other sale or
            transfer of some or all of Checkbook’s assets, whether as a going
            concern or as part of bankruptcy, liquidation, or similar
            proceeding, in which personal information held by Checkbook about
            our Service’s users is among the assets transferred.
          </p>
          <p>
            We may also share your Personal Information to fulfill the purpose
            for which you provide it, for any other purpose disclosed by us when
            you provide it, and with your consent
          </p>
          <p>
            We may provide information that does not identify you as an
            individual to third parties. We do this to analyze how the Service
            is running, diagnose service or technical problems, maintain
            security, and personalize content. We do not control these third
            parties’ tracking technologies or how they may be used. If you have
            any questions about how a third party may use your information, you
            should contact the third party directly.

            interest-based advertising.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Exercising Your Rights Under California Law</b> The California

            request, such as verifying that the email address from which you
            send the request matches your email address that we have on file.
            Authentication based on a government-issued and valid identification
            document may be required. If you are a customer of a checkbook user,
            please direct your requests directly to the Checkbook User with whom
