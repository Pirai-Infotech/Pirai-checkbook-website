          <p>
            Your use of Checkbook’s products, software, services and web sites
            (referred to collectively as the “Services” in this document and
            excluding any services provided to you by Checkbook under a separate
            written agreement) is subject to the terms of a legal agreement
            between you and Checkbook. “Checkbook” means Checkbook Inc., whose
            principal place of business is at 1500 Fashion Island Blvd, Suite
            103 San Mateo, CA 94404 United States. This document explains how
            the agreement is made up, and sets out some of the terms of that
            agreement. Unless otherwise agreed in writing with Checkbook, your
            agreement with Checkbook will always include, at a minimum, the
            terms and conditions set out in this document. These are referred to
            below as the “Universal Terms”. Your agreement with Checkbook will
            also include the terms of any Legal Notices applicable to the
            Services, in addition to the Universal Terms. All of these are
            referred to below as the “Additional Terms”. Where Additional Terms
            apply to a Service, these will be accessible for you to read either
            within, or through your use of, that Service. The Universal Terms,
            together with the Additional Terms, form a legally binding agreement
            between you and Checkbook in relation to your use of the Services.
            It is important that you take the time to read them carefully.
            Collectively, this legal agreement is referred to below as the
            “Terms”. If there is any contradiction between what the Additional
            Terms say and what the Universal Terms say, then the Additional
            Terms shall take precedence in relation to that Service.
          </p>

            when it has collected funds/payments from your Payors and you agree
            to credit your Payors’ accounts at the time Checkbook provides such

            Agreement; (ii) your refusal or failure of to fully and timely
            perform in accordance herewith any of its warranties, agreements,

            any Claim, Checkbook will notify you of the commencement thereof,
            but the omission to so notify you will not relive it from any
            liability which it may have to Checkbook hereunder. In the event of
            any Claim, Checkbook shall be entitled to assume and control the
            defense thereof, with counsel satisfactory to Checkbook, acting
            reasonably. Expenses (including attorneys’ fees and costs) incurred
            by Checkbook in connection with any Claim must be paid by you in
            advance immediately upon the written request of Checkbook and
            evidenced in writing once paid; provided Checkbook shall undertake
            to repay such expense advances to the extent that it is ultimately
            determined that Checkbook is not entitled to indemnification.
